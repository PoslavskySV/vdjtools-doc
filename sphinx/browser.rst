VDJviz
------

In order to demonstrate VDJtools API features, a lightweight immune
repertoire browser **VDJviz** was implemented by
[@bvdmitri](https://github.com/bvdmitri). It allows visualizing and
comparing various immune repertoire features such as spectratypes and
rarefaction curves. \* To try it out register at
`vdjviz.milaboratory.com <http://vdjviz.milaboratory.com/>`__ and upload
files from ``examples/`` folder of VDJtools repository

   application that uses `D3js <http://d3js.org/>`__ for interactive
   visualization of VDJtools output
